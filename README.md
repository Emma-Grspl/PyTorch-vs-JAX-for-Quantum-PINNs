# Quantum Harmonic Oscillator PINN Benchmark

This repository provides a reproducible benchmark of **PyTorch** and **JAX** on the same physics-informed neural network (PINN) task: learning the one-dimensional ground-state wavefunction of the quantum harmonic oscillator.

The project now supports two training regimes:

- `physics_only`: the model is trained only from the stationary Schrödinger equation and auxiliary physical constraints.
- `physics_plus_data`: the same physical loss is augmented with analytical supervision points sampled from the closed-form solution.

The codebase is organized to keep the benchmark reproducible, inspectable, and easy to extend.

## Problem Statement

We solve the stationary Schrödinger equation for the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator:

$$
\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 x^2\right)\psi(x) = E \psi(x)
$$

The benchmark focuses on the ground state (`state_index = 0`) and compares how well PyTorch and JAX learn:

- the normalized wavefunction `psi(x)`
- the associated energy `E`

The analytical solution is available, which allows direct evaluation through:

- relative `L2` error on `psi(x)`
- absolute energy error `|E_pred - E_exact|`

## PINN Architecture

Both frameworks use the same conceptual model:

- a fully connected multilayer perceptron with input dimension `1` (`x`)
- configurable hidden layers from `config/quantum_oscillator.yaml`
- a scalar trainable energy parameter optimized jointly with the network weights

The training objective combines several terms:

- PDE residual loss from the stationary Schrödinger equation
- boundary loss at the domain edges
- normalization loss to enforce `||psi|| = 1`
- center derivative loss to encode ground-state symmetry
- sign loss to stabilize the ground-state branch
- optional supervised data loss in `physics_plus_data`

The optimization pipeline is also aligned across frameworks:

- `Adam`
- a shared plateau scheduler
- early stopping
- gradient clipping

These directories are intentionally kept out of version control. The repository should track **code, configs, launch scripts, and curated final figures**, not every raw run artifact.

### Curated assets

- `assets/figures/`: final repository-ready figures selected from the benchmark outputs

## Installation

Create a clean Python environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want GPU-backed JAX, install the appropriate JAX build for your machine or cluster.

## Reproducibility Workflow

The repository distinguishes three local artifact layers:

- `outputs/quantum_oscillator/artifacts/` for raw benchmark runs, weights, predictions, and metrics
- `outputs/quantum_oscillator/analysis/` for JSON manifests and non-figure derived files
- `results/quantum_oscillator/` for generated figures

For public-facing documentation, only selected figures should be copied to `assets/figures/`.

## How To Use The Repository

### Run a single framework locally

```bash
python scripts/train_pytorch.py
python scripts/train_jax.py
```

### Run a local benchmark

Physics-only:

```bash
python scripts/run_benchmark.py \
  --frameworks pytorch jax \
  --repeats 3 \
  --warmup 1 \
  --epochs 4000 \
  --objective physics_only \
  --results-subdir local_physics_only
```

Physics + analytical data:

```bash
python scripts/run_benchmark.py \
  --frameworks pytorch jax \
  --repeats 3 \
  --warmup 1 \
  --epochs 4000 \
  --objective physics_plus_data \
  --n-data 32 \
  --lambda-data 1.0 \
  --results-subdir local_physics_plus_data_32
```

### Run on Jean Zay

Edit `launch/jz_submit.slurm` if needed, then submit:

```bash
sbatch launch/jz_submit.slurm
```

Separated time-to-target workflow:

1. Compute the PyTorch targets:

```bash
sbatch launch/jz_compute_pytorch_targets.slurm
```

2. Reuse the generated `pytorch_targets.json` in the JAX-only job:

```bash
export TARGETS_FILE=/path/to/pytorch_targets.json
sbatch launch/jz_jax_time_to_target.slurm
```

### Generate plots from saved artifacts

Per experiment:

```bash
python scripts/plot_physics_only_results.py \
  --run-dir outputs/quantum_oscillator/artifacts/hpc_jz_<job_id>
```

Global comparison across the final experiments:

```bash
python scripts/plot_benchmark_comparison.py
```

Separated time-to-target comparison:

```bash
python scripts/plot_time_to_target_comparison.py
```

## Key Figures

The most useful generated figures are:

- benchmark summaries for each experiment
- best-run reconstructions against the analytical solution
- `psi(x)` snapshots with supervision points for `physics_plus_data`
- run-by-run error plots
- global comparison bars across training regimes
- speed-versus-accuracy trade-off plots
- time-to-target success-rate bars against the PyTorch-derived targets
- PyTorch full-budget time versus JAX median time-to-target

Curated figures should live in `assets/figures/`.

## Main Findings

### Physics-only training

- PyTorch converges to a more accurate solution than JAX on this stationary PINN task.
- JAX remains significantly faster in total execution time.
- The shared scheduler improves fairness by aligning the optimization logic across frameworks.

### Physics + data training

- Adding analytical supervision points improves both frameworks substantially.
- JAX closes much of the precision gap once data is introduced.
- PyTorch remains slightly more accurate, while JAX keeps a clear time advantage.

### Effect of increasing the number of supervised points

- Moving from `n = 32` to `n = 64` gives a smaller incremental gain than the jump from `physics_only` to `physics_plus_data`.
- The ranking does not change: PyTorch is still more accurate, JAX is still faster.

### Time-to-target from PyTorch-derived accuracy thresholds

We also evaluated a second question: if the PyTorch median accuracy is used as the target, how quickly can JAX reach it?

- In `physics_only`, the PyTorch median target is relatively loose (`L2 ≈ 9.15e-2`, `|dE| ≈ 1.76e-2`) because the PyTorch reference runs are bimodal: two runs converge well, three remain much worse.
- Under this physics-only target, JAX reaches the `L2` target in `5/5` runs, but reaches the energy target and the joint target in only `3/5` runs.
- The median JAX time to hit both physics-only targets is about `6.01 s`, versus about `32.44 s` for a full PyTorch training run. This is informative, but it should be interpreted cautiously because the target itself is softened by the unstable PyTorch median.
- In `physics_plus_data` with `n = 64`, the PyTorch target is much stricter (`L2 ≈ 1.42e-2`, `|dE| ≈ 9.39e-4`).
- Under this mixed supervision target, JAX reaches `L2`, energy, and the joint target in `5/5` runs.
- The median JAX time to hit both data-assisted targets is about `10.46 s`, while the mean PyTorch full training time is about `35.01 s`.
- The final JAX median after the full run is substantially better than the PyTorch-derived target in the mixed regime (`L2 ≈ 1.43e-3`, `|dE| ≈ 1.46e-5`), which shows that once data is introduced, JAX not only catches up but overshoots the target reliably.

The corresponding comparison figures are available in:

- `assets/figures/time_to_target_success_rates.png`
- `assets/figures/time_to_target_cost.png`

## Conclusion

This repository supports a defensible benchmark story:

- **PyTorch** is the stronger framework for raw accuracy on this quantum PINN benchmark.
- **JAX** is the stronger framework for execution speed.
- Under pure physics supervision, the gap in accuracy is wider.
- Under mixed physics-and-data supervision, the gap narrows substantially and both frameworks become highly accurate.
- In the separated time-to-target study, JAX reaches the PyTorch-derived target reliably only once analytical data is introduced; under pure physics supervision, the joint target is not reached consistently across seeds.

That makes the project useful beyond a simple speed test. It shows that the framework ranking depends not only on the network architecture, but also on the training regime and the amount of analytical supervision.
